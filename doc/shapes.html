<p>The shape package is an extension of the geometry-part of the typeCase
analysis-framework. The shapes defined here are located in 3-dimensional
space. There exist two different types of shapes: the planar shapes, cut out of
a plane in 3D-space that can be used as geometrical representations of pixels
in a given more-layered detector and the volume shapes, that model the volume
of detectors and their elements.</p>
<p>For the volumes it is of interest, what happens when a straight line
(perhaps in later versions also curved lines) hits this volume. The hit point
can be retrieved via <var>entrance()</var>, the normal-vector of the surface in
the entrance-point is given by <var>Normal()</var>; <var>distance()</var>
provides the distance-vector from the line to the shape and
<var>Hitting()</var> returns that all at once. Leaves me to mention
<var>getFilghtPathInShape()</var> which returns the distance from entrance to
exit point.<br>
It is possible to generate out of the element with number zero the envelope of
the detector or any other element in the detector layer (<var>getNext()</var>
and <var>getEnvelope()</var>). The method <var>suspect()</var> combines this
property with the line-intersection-calculation: it generates the element
number of the potential element (if this element has number zero) that could be
hit by the line.</p>
<p>The planar shapes also define a distance method returning the distance from
a straight line or a plane to the shape, as well as an area and a
circumscribedRadius to retrieve the size of the shape.</p>
<hr/>
<p>All shapes come with a <var>draw()</var>-function that draws the shape to a
<a href="http://root.cern.ch">root</a>-Canvas.</p>
<p>The shape package depends on the geometry- and the parameter part of the
typeCase-framework. It is the first part of the typeCase analysis framework,
that requires an additional external library for complete functionality. Since
it uses <a href="http://root.cern.ch">root</a> classes for drawing
(eg. TPolyLine), the package only works if a root distribution is present on
the current system.</p>
