<table><tr><td>
<p>The AlgorithmOrderWidget gives you the possibility to select the order in which
the algorithms should be executed for one given event. Certainly the reading
should be done before the processing of the data, but since the program doesn't
distinguish between different algorithms, the user has to specify the sorting
of the algorithms himself.</p>
<p>Selected algorithms can be moved up by pressing the "u"-Key, moved down with
the "n"-Key or removed (unselected) by pressing the "d"-Key.</p>
<p>The individual parameters of the algorithms can also be altered at this
step.</p>
