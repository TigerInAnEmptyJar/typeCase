<p>The geometry package is the most basic part of the typeCase analysis
framework. It implements such useful things as 2- and 3-dimensional points and
vectors, straight lines both in 2D and 3D, connections between 2D- and
3D-points, a plane and a rotation matrix in 3D-space.</p>
<p>For the use in physics 4D (better (3+1)D) points and vectors have been
implemented peaking in <a href="momentum4d.html">momentum4D</a> a full
4D-lorentzian momentum vector with many useful methods and properties.<br/>
In this course the static class <a href="eparticles.html">Eparticles</a> has
been added, providing the user with particle masses, -lifetimes and -charges.</p>
<p>Stepping away from the restricted geometry part classes for use in linear
algebra have been implemented: points, vectors and matrices have been defined
in a general way not restricting the dimension of the space the object is
located in.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The development of this package was not planed a priori. The plan was to use
the classes defined in the <a
href="root.cern.ch">root-framework</a> to have well tested and reliable data
structures. Unfortunately this proved to be wrong. The definition of the
geometrical root classes was troubling and important methods were not visible
outside the class definition. Additionally many operators have been implemented
only recently, so in the later versions, that were the base to the typeCase
analysis-framework, these operators were not present.<br/>
But the most important reason for the redefinition of the matriy classes was
the problem of the memory management implemented in the
root-framework. Initially well meant, the reimplementation of memory-management
led to unspecified behaviour of the used components.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The geometry package is only based on standard C++ libraries. No further
installation of other packages is necessary to compile and use the geometry
package. It can be used as stand-alone package if desired, but it is the base
to the other parts of the typeCase-analysis-framework.</p>
