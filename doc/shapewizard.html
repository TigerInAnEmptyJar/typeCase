<table><tr><td>
<p>For an easy installation of additional components, meta-code classes and
wizards have been implemented.<br/>
Since plugins are not used for this program, the call and use of the shapes for the
analysis is done individually. To add a shape to the package results in
editing more than a handful of files and adding text to heade, code and
makefiles alike.<br/>
To simplify this procedure the meta-code-class shapeWriter has been
implemented with the shapeWizard as GUI-frontend. </p>
<p>The wizard guides the user through the specification of the necessary files
and the parameter that can be passed to the shape during
initialisation. 
<p>All specified values can be written to file as an install-log for
distribution along with the new shape or simply for later use.</p>
