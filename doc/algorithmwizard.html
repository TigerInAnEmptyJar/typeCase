<table><tr><td>
<p>For an easy installation of additional components, meta-code classes and
wizards have been implemented.<br/>
Since plugins are not used for this program, the call of the algorithms for the
analysis are done individually. To add an algorithm to the package results in
editing more than a handful of files and adding text to heade, code and
makefiles alike.<br/>
To simplify this procedure the meta-code-class algorithmWriter has been
implemented with the algorithmWizard as GUI-frontend. </p>
<p>The wizard guides the user through the specification of the necessary files
and the parameter that can be passed to the algorithm during
initialisation. <a
href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.7/signalsandslots.html">Connections</a> can be
specified for the algorithm to the main analysis-class <a
href="tofanalysis.html">tofAnalysis</a>.</p>
<p>All specified values can be written to file as an install-log for
distribution along with the new algorithm or simply for later use.</p>
