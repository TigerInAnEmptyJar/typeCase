DReturns a translated version of sourceText, or sourceText itself if there is no

DWarning: This method is reentrant only if all translators are installed before calling 
Dthis method. Installing or removing translators while performing translations is not

DThe meta object information is required by the signal/slot connection mechanism 
Dand the property system. The functions isA() and inherits() also make use of the meta object.
