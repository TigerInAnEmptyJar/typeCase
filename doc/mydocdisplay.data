DReturns a pointer to the meta object of this object. 
DA meta object contains information about a class that inherits QObject, e.g. class name,
Dsuperclass name, properties, signals and slots. Every class that contains the 
DQ_OBJECT macro will also have a meta object. 
DThe meta object information is required by the signal/slot connection mechanism 
Dand the property system. The functions isA() and inherits() also make use of the meta object.
