<p>The analysis widget is the widget where the actual analysis takes place. It
receives all selected parameters from the algorithm widget and the data-base
widget. </p>
<p>The main part of the widget is covered by a <a href="root.cern.ch/root/html524/TCanvas.html">canvas</a> that displays during
analysis information about the current analysis. This can be the event pattern
(see picture) or a histogram, the leaf of a tree or other information</p>
<p>The colored button on the bottom shows the status of the analysis. red for
non initialized, yellow for initalized, green for running.</p>
<p>The following buttons have this effects:

<dt>Algorithm </dt><dd>opens the <a
href="orderselectionwidget.html">OrderSelectionWidget</a>. Here you can specify
in which order the selected algorithms should be executed for each event. You
can also add Data-Input- and -Output-Algorithms along with reaction-recognition
algorithms. </dd>
<dt>Watch </dt><dd>opens the <a
href="viewselectionwidget.html">ViewSelectionWidget</a> where you can specify
which information about the running analysis you want to see during
analysis.</dd>
<dt>Help</dt> <dd>opens the <a href="helpwidget.html">helpWidget</a> with
information about the analysis widget. In essence: this page.</dd>
<dt>Init</dt><dd> Initializes the analysis with the current algorithm and data-basis
parameter sets. Setup is initialized with the files provided by the first run.</dd>
<dt>Start</dt><dd> If initialized, this button starts the analysis which will
run until stoped or ran out of events to analyse.</dd>
<dt>Step</dt><dd> If initialized, this button starts the analysis for a
specified number of events (see input on bottom of widget) or until end of
events whichever happens earlier.</dd>
<dt>Stop</dt> <dd>If running this button stops the analysis.</dd>
<dt>Final</dt> <dd> If initialized this button finalizes the analysis. This
calls the destructors for all of the algorithms and is essential for the
writing algorithms to close the open files and also for the algorithms that
do the main part of the analysis during finalisation.</dd>
