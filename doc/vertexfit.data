DMain fitting routine. Fits the lines to a common vertex and returns the chi² of the fit. 
=
DClass for fitting several lines with a common vertex. Works for 1 and 2 lines will have to be extended for more lines. An object of this class can first do a 2-line-fit, then a 1-line-fit, then a 2-line fit. The number of lines to be fitted is calculated on the fly.
