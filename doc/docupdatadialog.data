DThe meta object information is required by the signal/slot connection mechanism 
Dand the property system. The functions isA() and inherits() also make use of the meta object.

DThis widget compares two classes and their methods and variables. If two methods (one from each class) match they are put into the tree-widget and if accepted, the description defined for the "old"-version is copied to the "new" one. 
DMethods, Variables, etc. that don't match are copied to the list-boxes at top for manual assignment.
