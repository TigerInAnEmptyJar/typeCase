<p>This widget gives you the possibility to choose which information to view
during analysis. The canvas can be devided and you can view different
properties in different pads.</p>
<p>There is the event pattern, that shows the current event projected on a plane
perpendicular to the beam axis. There is the event information: number of
analysed events, time it took etc. There is also the possibility to view
internal analysis histograms and draw trees, if the algorithm that fills it
allows for it.</p>
