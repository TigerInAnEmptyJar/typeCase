DConstructor. Sets the target particles 4-momentum and the volume shape. As shape for the target, a pointer of <var>shape</var> and no copy is saved. So take care, that the object persists in memory and that you delete it after use, if necessary.

DThis is the target class. A target here is defined by a volume shape, a temperature and a 4-momentum for the particle. This class is still incomplete and will be modified, when needed. Like all the other container classes, this class provides no functionality for itself, it has to be filled during the analysis.
