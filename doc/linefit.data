DStatic method. Fits a line to <var>numPoints</var> points in 3D. The <var>resolution</var>-vectors are the vectors in which the points can be modified, the <var>sigma</var>s, the errors for the points.  
D<br>Take care, that the arrays <var>points</var>, <var>resolution</var> and <var>sigmas</var> are at least <var>numPoints</var> indeces long.  
D<br>The result of the fit is given by the straight line <var>result</var>, where the Foot of the line is always in the x-y-plane.<br>  
DThe return value is the chi² value of the fit.

DThis class implements a simple line fit in 3D.
