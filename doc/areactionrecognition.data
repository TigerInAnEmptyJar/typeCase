DConstructor. The <var>setup</var> is needed to get the initial conditions (beam(s) and target) for the reaction recognition, <var>eventIn</var> is needed to get the event-information, like tracks, trigger, etc. The <var>kinfit</var>-variable is passed to the reactions if it is not NULL. Most likely it is not used, but the <a href="kinfit.html"> kinFit</a> from the fit-package is used.
DIn <var>processes</var> a description of the reactions to check including cuts, etc. is passed to the RR.

DMain function. It is called once every event. Here for every defined reaction the function <a href="rbasereaction.html#f12">checkNew(...)</a> is called and saved if the result is not NULL.

DThis function defines the reactions to check along with the necessary parameters by parsing the <var>option</var>-string.
DThis function is obsolete and only used if you use the (also obsolete) <a href="areactionrecognition.html#c2"> constructor</a>.

DThis algorithm belongs to the basic algorithms. As the <a href="tofanalysis.html">tofAnalysis</a> the algorithm AReactionRecognition does not do any reaction-recognition itself, but it hosts the reaction classes that do the reaction-recognition themselves and only starts the RR and sorts the possible reactions for the event itself.
