<p>The fit package is one of the smaller parts of the typeCase-analysis
framework. It is based on the <a href="geometry.html>geometry-part</a> of the
analysis-framework, but none else.</p>
<p>It contains the single line fit, that does in 3-dimensional space a fit to a
number of points, returning a fitted straight line.</p>
<p>Second is the vertex fit that fits any number of lines (with their points
assigned to the individual lines) to a common vertex or footing point. Though
in principle possible to fit more than 3 lines at once it is strongly
recomended to use a maximum of 3 at a time.</p>
<p>Last but not least is the most complicated fit of the set: the kinematical
fit (kinFit). The first two fits being purely geometrical fits of points to (a)
line(s), the kinFit imposes kinematical constraints on a set of reaction
products. Basic here is the momentum- and energy-conservation, basic laws of
physics. Using the gradient method with lagrangean multipliers, the initial
momentum values of the particles to fit are modified using provided errors.</p>
