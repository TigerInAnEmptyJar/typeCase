The typeCase analysis package is a versatile analysis tool for the use in
nuclear physics. It can analyse all event based data from any detector-system.
Its main features are
<ol>
<li>Flexibility both in detector-setup and analysis-method
<li>Low divergency
<li>Easy to use
<li>Easy to adapt
<li>Easy to extend
</ol>
To meet these points a simple frame-work was defined separating the data from
the generation algorithms. The algorithms are allocated dynamically according
to description passed to the main analysis tool. Also the detector-setup is
defined just prior to the analysis by loading detector descriptions from
file. Composed objects like pixel, cluster, tracks are generated using the
algorithms. Data-IO is possible at any position/stage of the analysis. Event
pattern can be separately written, reaction-recognition performed.

To make the program very easy to use and even useful in some online analysis, a
Graphical User Interface was designed helping the user to define the necessary
parameters, like setup, shapes, materials, data-basis, calibration, algorithms,
etc. 
<br>
Also extension of the current frame-work is made easy using the install-wizards
for algorithms and shapes.
<br>For the more advanced user there is also the possibility to use a version
of the analysis-program in a command-line-version without any graphics poping up.
<br>See the documentation of the <a href="classes.html">classes</a> of the
frame-work and the description of the individual widgets for the <a href="typecasewidget.html">Graphical User
Interface</a>.
