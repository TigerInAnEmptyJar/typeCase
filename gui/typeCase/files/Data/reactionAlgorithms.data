several reactions defined by reaction algorithm
parameters and stores them in the Event.

proton-proton colisions. Quite useful
for calibration purpurses.

5 Being a two body reaction, this reaction
is the one of the most basic reaction in
proton-proton colisions. Even better for 
calibration purpurses, since the velocities 
of the deuteron are smaller than in pp-elastic.

2 0 0 10 0 0 0 0 1 0.109 Max angle between Lambda_rec and Lambda_meas
0 0 0 0 0 Lambda-production
6 This is a strangeness producing reaction,
where a neutral strange baryon and a charged
kaon are produced. Essential to recognize 
this reaction is a neutral decay (of the
Lambda particle) and two prompt tracks, both
having velocities defined.
